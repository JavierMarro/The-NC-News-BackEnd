But my time spent using React has given me some insight into when and why it might be appropriate to use another technology — Redux (a variant of the Flux architecture).",

Express.js and Node.js gave JavaScript newfound back-end functionality—allowing developers to build software with JavaScript on the server side for the first time. Together, they make it possible to build an entire site with JavaScript: You can develop server-side applications with Node.js and then publish those Node.js apps as websites with Express. Because Node.js itself wasn’t intended to build websites, the Express framework is able to layer in built-in structure and functions needed to actually build a site. It’s a pretty lightweight framework that’s great for giving developers extra, built-in web application features and the Express API without overriding the already robust, feature-packed Node.js platform. In short, Express and Node are changing the way developers build websites.",

    topic: "coding",
    author: "cooljmessy",
    body: "When designing an application that will communicate with a remote computer, a data format and exchange protocol must be selected. There are a variety of open, standardized options, and the ideal choice depends on the applications requirements and pre-existing functionality. For example, SOAP-based web services format the data in an XML payload wrapped within a SOAP envelope. While XML works well for many application scenarios, it has some drawbacks that make it less than ideal for others. One such space where XML is often less than ideal is with Ajax-style web applications. Ajax is a technique used for building interactive web applications that provide a snappier user experience through the use of out-of-band, lightweight calls to the web server in lieu of full-page postbacks. These asynchronous calls are initiated on the client using JavaScript and involve formatting data, sending it to a web server, and parsing and working with the returned data. While most browsers can construct, send, and parse XML, JavaScript Object Notation (or JSON) provides a standardized data exchange format that is better-suited for Ajax-style web applications. JSON is an open, text-based data exchange format (see RFC 4627). Like XML, it is human-readable, platform independent, and enjoys a wide availability of implementations. Data formatted according to the JSON standard is lightweight and can be parsed by JavaScript implementations with incredible ease, making it an ideal data exchange format for Ajax web applications. Since it is primarily a data format, JSON is not limited to just Ajax web applications, and can be used in virtually any scenario where applications need to exchange or store structured information as text. This article examines the JSON standard, its relationship to JavaScript, and how it compares to XML. Jayrock, an open-source JSON implementation for .NET, is discussed and examples of creating and parsing JSON messages are provided in JavaScript and C#.",

    body: "Kendo, meaning 'way of the sword', is a modern Japanese martial art that focuses on the use of bamboo swords (shinai) and protective armor (bogu). Rooted in the traditions of samurai swordsmanship, it emphasizes discipline, respect, and personal development. In kendo, practitioners, known as kendoka, aim to strike their opponent’s designated targets—men (head), kote (wrists), do (body), and tsuki (throat)—with proper form and precision. Each strike must be accompanied by a loud vocal shout (kiai) to express spirit and intent. Kendo is not just about physical skill; it is a mental and spiritual journey. It teaches focus, humility, and perseverance, fostering self-control and respect for others. Whether for self-defense, sport, or personal growth, kendo offers a unique combination of tradition and physical challenge. Beginners typically start with basic footwork, strikes, and etiquette before advancing to more complex techniques. Through consistent practice and dedication, students can progress in rank, eventually earning the highest level, 8th dan. Kendo is accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds, making it an enriching pursuit for anyone looking to deepen their martial arts experience.",

Students enter the dojo with respect, keeping their uniforms neat and their behavior disciplined. The shinai (bamboo sword) is treated with care, reflecting the practitioner’s attitude toward their weapon and the art itself. Through these rituals, kendo encourages humility, self-control, and mindfulness. Proper etiquette is not only a sign of respect but also an important part of cultivating a focused and disciplined mind, essential for growth both inside and outside the dojo.",

Practitioners push through physical and mental challenges, learning to overcome weaknesses and embrace failure as part of growth. The rigorous practice not only strengthens the body but also nurtures patience and perseverance.

In the 1990s, Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls brought unprecedented global attention to the NBA, while players like Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan continued to push the sport’s boundaries in the 2000s. The most recent evolution has seen the rise of the three-point shot, led by players like Stephen Curry, changing the way the game is played.

Sources taken from military manuals at the time describe an exercise called Tsu’ Chu, in which opponents used a leather ball filled with feathers and hair.

    body: "At lunchtime on the day of the Champions League final in 2012, Chelsea’s manager Roberto Di Matteo had selected 10 of his 11 players. He just didn’t know who to play in left midfield. The player would have to combat Bayern Munich’s brilliant Arjen Robben and Philipp Lahm. Going into the last team meeting, Di Matteo had a private chat with his left-back, Ashley Cole. He outlined the situation, then asked Cole who he would play at left-midfield. Instead of naming a seasoned star, Cole said: “Ryan Bertrand.” The 22-year-old reserve Bertrand had never played in the Champions League, let alone in club football’s biggest game. “Why?” asked Di Matteo, surprised. “I trust him,” replied Cole. Bertrand played well, and Chelsea beat Bayern on penalties. In part, this was a victory for talent management. Di Matteo had put aside his ego, and let trust between two players drive the decision. Talent management has been a business obsession at least since 1997, when the consultancy McKinsey identified a “war for talent”. The most visible battleground of this “war” is team sport. Football, in particular, is “the quintessential model for modern-day talent-dependent business”, writes Chris Brady, professor at Salford Business School. Big football clubs pay more than half their revenues to between 3 and 7 per cent of their workforce: the players. These young men are rich, multinational, mobile, often equipped with large egos and therefore hard to manage. Football managers are, above all, talent managers.",
